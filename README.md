# GLOOM-Depression-Predictor
Depression, a prevalent and debilitating mental illness, is frequently undiagnosed.
Diagnosis is an important step towards treatment. Currently screening tools, such as the Patient
Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), require patient input. Many studies have used a variety of data
types and features to predict depression scores for individuals. In this study, we focus on the
predictive ability of a single under-utilized modality indicative of the impact of social
interactions: received text messages. Our approach encompasses creating subsets of influential
contacts for each participant and engineering features from the text messages of those contact
subsets. The project tries to automatically predict this score based on parameters such as age, 
number of messages received and number of social media applications used.
